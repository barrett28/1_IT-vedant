                <h2 class="animated-underline">Enhanced Strength</h2>
                <p>

                    Steve Rogers possesses strength that allows him to
                    perform feats like lifting heavy objects, breaking
                    through barriers, and overpowering numerous foes in
                    combat.
                </p>

                <h2 class="animated-underline">Enhanced Agility and Reflexes</h2>
                <p>
                    His agility and reflexes are heightened to the peak of
                    human capability, enabling him to dodge bullets, perform
                    acrobatic maneuvers, and engage in complex combat
                    sequences with precision.
                </p>

                <h2 class="animated-underline">Enhanced Stamina and Healing</h2>
                <p>
                    Captain America's stamina is far superior to that of an
                    average person, allowing him to exert himself for
                    extended periods without fatigue. His healing is also
                    accelerated, enabling him to recover from injuries
                    faster than normal, though not instantaneously like some
                    other superheroes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="animated-underline">Master Combatant and Tactician</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to his physical enhancements, Steve is a
                    master hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in various
                    martial arts and armed combat. His indestructible
                    shield, made of vibranium, is both a defensive tool and
                    a weapon, capable of absorbing impacts and being thrown
                    with deadly accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    These abilities, combined with his indomitable will and
                    strategic mind, make Captain America one of the most
                    formidable heroes in the Marvel Universe.
